## Bounties

After some requests, we've decided to create for everything bounties for those who are interested in open source contributing to Aori and the projects built on top of it and the trading teams tapping into them.

Below, we have listed all bounties for Aori. We advocate open source code development for the benefit of the community. We've divided the bounties into a few sections:
- [Market Making üåä](#market-making-)
- [Market Taking üí±](#market-taking-)
- [Products ‚ú®](#products-)
- [Data üìä](#data-)
